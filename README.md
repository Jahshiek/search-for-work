There are various job search APIs available that can be used to fetch job listings and display them on a web page using JavaScript. Alternatively, you can also scrape job search websites using JavaScript libraries such as Cheerio or Puppeteer.

To create a job search program using JavaScript, you will need to have a good understanding of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will also need to have knowledge of APIs, HTTP requests, and data manipulation.

Here are some steps you can follow to create a job search program using JavaScript:
a. Choose an API or job search website to fetch job listings from.
b. Use JavaScript to fetch the job listings data from the API or website.
c. Parse the data and display the job listings on a web page using HTML and CSS.
d. Add search filters to allow users to refine their job search.
e. Add functionality to allow users to apply for jobs directly from your web page.
f. Test your application and deploy it to a server or hosting service.
